# Powershell Sys/Sec Admin

Many times System and Security Admininstrators must use Powershell to complete various task or make various checks on the network or system. This menu was created in hopes to make this process a little bit easier by automating these tasks / commands.

This is a system admin and security admin menu using powershell scripting language. This menu allows the user to select options on which task they would like to complete by just selecting the task they would like to complete. For example instead of manually executing some of the commands one may need to execute as a sys or sec admin, the user would just select the option they would liek to be complete. On top of being able to easily perform system or security admin tasks, this menu saves all outputs to one file, and asks the user if they would like the view the contents of that file to check their work.
